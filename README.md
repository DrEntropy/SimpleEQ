# SimpleEQ

This is from a (free) tutorial from MatKat Music:

MatKat's version of the code:

I skipped the spectrum analyzer part since it uses classes that MatKat just drops in from the Project 11 course.  Since every other line in this plugin I added manually, I didn't want to start now with blackbox stuff.  Perhaps someday I will come back and add that, but I suspect I will not.
